The combat simulator only works on windows as it's a windows executable file.

In order to run the combat simulator (hsbg.exe) you need to ensure gcc g++ is installed. 

This can be done using Cygwin which can be downloaded here:

https://www.cygwin.com/

Once downloaded, it needs to be ran with the on scree steps followed. When Cygwin asks for packages 
to be installed, search for "g++" and choose all the options (should be 5).

Once installed, the path for the dll's needs to be added to windows system paths.
